# Linearizable Counter
The purpose of this repo to explore linearizability, using the concurrent counter data structure as a toy problem on which to test ideas.

Eventually, there should be proofs of the linearizability of the counter in at least:
* Z3 - https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3
* Lean - https://leanprover.github.io/
* Prolog - http://www.swi-prolog.org/

Optimally, the wiki pages of this repo will be used to record insights and ideas with which we come up along the way.
