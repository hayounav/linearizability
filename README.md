# Linearizable Objects
The purpose of this repo to explore linearizability, using the concurrent data types, such as counter and snapshot data structures, as toy problems on which to test ideas.

## Implemetations
Eventually, there should be proofs of the linearizability of the counter in at least:
* Z3 - https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3
* Lean - https://leanprover.github.io/
* Prolog - http://www.swi-prolog.org/ (this might not happen)

Optimally, the wiki pages of this repo will be used to record insights and ideas with which we come up along the way.

## Coding environments
### emacs
* Z3- https://github.com/zv/z3-mode
* Lean - https://github.com/leanprover/lean/tree/master/src/emacs
